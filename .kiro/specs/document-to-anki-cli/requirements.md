# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves creating a modern Python application that converts digital documents into Anki flashcards using Large Language Models (specifically Gemini). The application will support both CLI and web interfaces, allowing users to upload single files, folders, or ZIP archives, preview and edit generated flashcards, and export them as Anki-importable CSV files. The application will leverage modern Python development practices with Python 3.12+, using uv for package management and incorporating best-in-class tools for development, testing, and user experience.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a student or learner, I want to upload various document formats and have them converted into Anki flashcards, so that I can efficiently study the content using spaced repetition.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user uploads content THEN the system SHALL accept single files (PDF, DOCX, TXT, MD), folders containing multiple files, or ZIP archives
2. WHEN processing uploads THEN the system SHALL extract readable text content from all supported files
3. WHEN multiple files are provided THEN the system SHALL process all files and consolidate flashcards into a single output
4. WHEN text is extracted THEN the system SHALL send the content to Gemini LLM with carefully crafted prompts to generate high-quality flashcard pairs
5. WHEN flashcards are generated THEN the system SHALL create both question-answer pairs and cloze deletion cards
6. WHEN processing completes THEN the system SHALL format output as Anki-importable CSV files

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the CLI to follow modern Python best practices, so that the codebase is maintainable, testable, and follows current standards.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN setting up the project THEN the system SHALL use uv for package management and dependency resolution
2. WHEN writing code THEN the system SHALL target Python 3.12+ compatibility
3. WHEN formatting code THEN the system SHALL use ruff for linting and formatting
4. WHEN testing THEN the system SHALL use pytest with pytest-mock for comprehensive test coverage
5. WHEN logging THEN the system SHALL use loguru for structured logging
6. WHEN displaying output THEN the system SHALL use rich for enhanced CLI user experience

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to preview and edit generated flashcards before exporting, so that I can ensure the quality and relevance of my study materials.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN flashcards are generated THEN the system SHALL display a consolidated list of all flashcards for review
2. WHEN reviewing flashcards THEN the system SHALL allow users to edit question and answer content
3. WHEN managing flashcards THEN the system SHALL allow users to delete unwanted flashcards
4. WHEN customizing content THEN the system SHALL allow users to manually add new flashcards
5. WHEN satisfied with content THEN the system SHALL provide an export function to generate the final CSV file

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want clear feedback during document processing, so that I understand the progress and can troubleshoot any issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing starts THEN the system SHALL display a progress indicator using rich components
2. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL provide clear, actionable error messages
3. WHEN processing completes THEN the system SHALL display a summary of generated flashcards
4. WHEN verbose mode is enabled THEN the system SHALL log detailed processing steps using loguru
5. WHEN the process fails THEN the system SHALL log error details and suggest potential solutions

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a data analyst, I want the application to handle document analysis efficiently, so that large documents can be processed without performance issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing large documents THEN the system SHALL use numpy and pandas for efficient data manipulation
2. WHEN chunking text THEN the system SHALL split large documents into manageable segments for LLM processing
3. WHEN handling multiple files THEN the system SHALL support batch processing capabilities
4. WHEN memory usage is high THEN the system SHALL implement streaming or chunked processing to manage resources
5. WHEN processing completes THEN the system SHALL clean up temporary files and resources

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a quality-conscious developer, I want comprehensive testing and code quality assurance, so that the application is reliable and maintainable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN developing features THEN the system SHALL maintain test coverage above 80%
2. WHEN running tests THEN the system SHALL use pytest with pytest-mock for mocking (avoiding unittest.mock)
3. WHEN checking code quality THEN the system SHALL pass ruff linting without errors
4. WHEN building the package THEN the system SHALL include proper type hints throughout the codebase and use Pydantic v2 for data validation
5. WHEN releasing THEN the system SHALL include comprehensive documentation and usage examples
### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user, I want both web and CLI interfaces available, so that I can choose the most convenient way to process my documents.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using the web interface THEN the system SHALL provide drag-and-drop functionality for file uploads
2. WHEN using the web interface THEN the system SHALL display progress indicators during processing
3. WHEN using the CLI THEN the system SHALL accept command-line arguments for batch processing
4. WHEN using either interface THEN the system SHALL provide the same core functionality
5. WHEN errors occur THEN both interfaces SHALL provide clear, actionable error messages

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a user, I want the web interface to be professional and accessible, so that I can use it effectively across different devices and abilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing the web interface THEN the system SHALL display a clean, modern, and professional design
2. WHEN using the interface THEN the system SHALL provide intuitive workflow guidance with clear instructions
3. WHEN interacting with the system THEN the system SHALL provide immediate visual feedback for all user actions
4. WHEN accessing from different devices THEN the system SHALL provide a fully responsive design for desktop, tablet, and mobile
5. WHEN used by people with disabilities THEN the system SHALL meet WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility standards

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the system to use Gemini LLM specifically with optimized prompts, so that flashcard generation quality is maximized.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN integrating with LLMs THEN the system SHALL use Gemini Pro model through litellm
2. WHEN generating flashcards THEN the system SHALL use carefully crafted prompts to identify key concepts and important facts
3. WHEN creating questions THEN the system SHALL generate clear, concise questions with accurate and relevant answers
4. WHEN producing variety THEN the system SHALL create a mix of question-answer and cloze deletion flashcards
5. WHEN processing content THEN the system SHALL instruct the model to focus on the most important information
