# Machine Learning Fundamentals

Machine Learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that enables computers to learn and make decisions from data without being explicitly programmed.

## Types of Machine Learning

### Supervised Learning
- Uses labeled training data
- Examples: Classification, Regression
- Algorithms: Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest

### Unsupervised Learning
- Works with unlabeled data
- Examples: Clustering, Dimensionality Reduction
- Algorithms: K-Means, PCA, DBSCAN

### Reinforcement Learning
- Learns through interaction with environment
- Uses rewards and penalties
- Applications: Game playing, Robotics

## Key Concepts

**Training Data**: The dataset used to train the model
**Features**: Input variables used to make predictions
**Labels**: The correct answers for supervised learning
**Model**: The algorithm that makes predictions
**Overfitting**: When a model performs well on training data but poorly on new data
