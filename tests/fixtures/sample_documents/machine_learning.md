# Machine Learning Fundamentals

Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of artificial intelligence that enables computers
to learn and make decisions from data without being explicitly programmed for every task.

## Types of Machine Learning

### Supervised Learning
- Uses labeled training data to learn patterns
- Examples: Classification and Regression
- Common algorithms: Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest

### Unsupervised Learning
- Finds patterns in data without labeled examples
- Examples: Clustering and Dimensionality Reduction
- Common algorithms: K-Means, PCA, DBSCAN

### Reinforcement Learning
- Learns through interaction with an environment
- Uses rewards and penalties to improve performance
- Applications: Game playing, Robotics, Autonomous vehicles

## Key Concepts

**Training Data**: The dataset used to train the machine learning model
**Features**: Input variables or attributes used to make predictions
**Labels**: The correct answers or target values for supervised learning
**Model**: The algorithm that learns patterns and makes predictions
**Overfitting**: When a model performs well on training data but poorly on new, unseen data
