Python Programming Basics

Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its simplicity and readability. It was created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991.

Key Features:
- Easy to learn and use
- Interpreted language
- Object-oriented programming support
- Large standard library
- Cross-platform compatibility

Data Types:
Python has several built-in data types including integers, floats, strings, lists, tuples, and dictionaries. Variables in Python are dynamically typed, meaning you don't need to declare their type explicitly.

Control Structures:
Python uses indentation to define code blocks. Common control structures include if-else statements, for loops, and while loops.

Functions:
Functions in Python are defined using the 'def' keyword. They can accept parameters and return values. Python also supports lambda functions for simple operations.
