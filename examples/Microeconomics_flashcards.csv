"If the demand curve is relatively {{c1::elastic}}, the deadweight loss of a tax is {{c2::large}}.",elastic::large,cloze,examples/Microeconomics.pdf
Explain why greater elasticities of supply and demand lead to a larger deadweight loss from a tax.,"Greater elasticities mean buyers and sellers respond more substantially to price changes induced by the tax (buyers consume less, sellers produce less), leading to a greater distortion of the market outcome and a larger shrinkage of the market below the optimum.",qa,examples/Microeconomics.pdf
The demand for beer is more elastic than the demand for milk. Would a tax on beer or a tax on milk have a larger deadweight loss?,"A tax on beer would have a larger deadweight loss because its demand is more elastic, meaning consumers will reduce their quantity demanded more significantly in response to the price increase from the tax.",qa,examples/Microeconomics.pdf
What is considered the most important tax in the U.S. economy?,The tax on labor.,qa,examples/Microeconomics.pdf
Which taxes are considered labor taxes in the U.S. economy?,"Social Security tax, Medicare tax, and the federal income tax (to a large extent).",qa,examples/Microeconomics.pdf
"For many workers, the marginal tax rate on labor income (the tax on the last dollar of earnings) is almost {{c1::50 percent}}.",50 percent,cloze,examples/Microeconomics.pdf
Economists disagree about the deadweight loss of labor taxes primarily because they hold different views about the elasticity of {{c1::labor supply}}.,labor supply,cloze,examples/Microeconomics.pdf
Economists who argue that labor taxes are not very distorting believe that labor supply is fairly {{c1::inelastic}}.,inelastic,cloze,examples/Microeconomics.pdf

Who was Henry George?,A nineteenth-century American economist and social philosopher.,qa,examples/Microeconomics.pdf
Henry George proposed that the government should raise all its revenue from a tax on {{c1::land}}.,land,cloze,examples/Microeconomics.pdf
Henry George's proposal for a 'single tax' on land was considered both {{c1::equitable}} and {{c2::efficient}}.,equitable::efficient,cloze,examples/Microeconomics.pdf
Why did Henry George argue that a tax on land would be efficient?,"Because the supply of raw land is perfectly inelastic, a tax on land does not alter the market allocation, resulting in no deadweight loss.",qa,examples/Microeconomics.pdf
"In the case of a tax on raw land, because the elasticity of supply is zero, the {{c1::landowners}} bear the entire burden of the tax.",landowners,cloze,examples/Microeconomics.pdf
Why is a tax on land not as straightforward in practice as it may appear in theory?,"To avoid distorting economic incentives, it must be a tax on raw land. However, the value of land often comes from improvements (e.g., clearing, sewers, roads), and the supply of improvements has an elasticity greater than zero. Taxing improvements would distort incentives.",qa,examples/Microeconomics.pdf
What was Milton Friedman's assessment of Henry George's land tax proposal?,He considered the property tax on the unimproved value of land to be 'the least bad tax'.,qa,examples/Microeconomics.pdf
"As the size of a tax rises, the deadweight loss of the tax grows {{c1::larger and larger}}.",larger and larger,cloze,examples/Microeconomics.pdf

How does tax revenue change as the size of a tax increases from small to very large?,"Initially, tax revenue rises with the tax size. However, for very large taxes, the deadweight loss becomes so significant that the market shrinks considerably, causing tax revenue to fall.",qa,examples/Microeconomics.pdf
A small tax has a {{c1::small}} deadweight loss and raises a {{c2::small}} amount of revenue.,small::small,cloze,examples/Microeconomics.pdf

Who first drew the figure illustrating how tax rates affect tax revenue on a napkin in 1974?,Arthur Laffer.,qa,examples/Microeconomics.pdf
Arthur Laffer suggested in 1974 that the United States was on the {{c1::downward-sloping}} side of the Laffer curve.,downward-sloping,cloze,examples/Microeconomics.pdf
What was Arthur Laffer's argument regarding U.S. tax rates in 1974?,Tax rates were so high that reducing them would actually raise tax revenue.,qa,examples/Microeconomics.pdf
Most economists were {{c1::skeptical}} of Laffer's suggestion that U.S. tax rates had reached extreme levels where a tax cut would raise revenue.,skeptical,cloze,examples/Microeconomics.pdf
The idea that a cut in tax rates could raise tax revenue was correct as a matter of {{c1::economic theory}}.,economic theory,cloze,examples/Microeconomics.pdf

Supply-side economics argues that lower tax rates would encourage people to increase the quantity of {{c1::labor they supplied}}.,labor they supplied,cloze,examples/Microeconomics.pdf
What personal experience did Ronald Reagan cite to support the idea that high tax rates discourage work?,"During World War II, when income surtax hit 90%, he and others would stop working after making four pictures because they would be in the top bracket.",qa,examples/Microeconomics.pdf
Ronald Reagan's personal experience with high wartime income surtaxes (90%) led him to believe that high tax rates caused {{c1::less work}}.,less work,cloze,examples/Microeconomics.pdf
Did Reagan's tax cuts in the 1980s confirm Laffer's conjecture that lower tax rates would raise tax revenue?,"No, they resulted in less tax revenue and large budget deficits.",qa,examples/Microeconomics.pdf

Give an example of a transaction cost that could prevent private parties from solving an externality problem.,"Hiring lawyers to draft and enforce contracts, or translators if parties speak different languages.",qa,examples/Microeconomics.pdf
How can bargaining breakdown prevent an efficient solution to an externality?,"Each party may try to hold out for a better deal, leading to an impasse where no agreement is reached, and the inefficient outcome persists.",qa,examples/Microeconomics.pdf
"Bargaining can break down if each party tries to {{c1::hold out for a better deal}}, preventing a mutually beneficial agreement.",hold out for a better deal,cloze,examples/Microeconomics.pdf
Why is reaching an efficient bargain especially difficult when the number of interested parties is large?,Coordinating a large number of individuals to bargain effectively is costly and often almost impossible.,qa,examples/Microeconomics.pdf
Why is it nearly impossible for a large group of fishermen affected by factory pollution to bargain effectively with the factory?,"Coordinating all the fishermen to agree on a strategy, contributions, and demands becomes extremely costly and complex due to the large number of interested parties.",qa,examples/Microeconomics.pdf
"When private bargaining does not work, the {{c1::government}} can sometimes play a role as an institution designed for collective action.",government,cloze,examples/Microeconomics.pdf
What are the two main ways the government can respond when an externality causes a market to reach an inefficient allocation of resources?,Command-and-control policies (regulate behavior directly) and market-based policies (provide incentives).,qa,examples/Microeconomics.pdf

Give an example of a command-and-control policy used to remedy an externality.,"Making it a crime to dump poisonous chemicals into the water supply, or the EPA dictating maximum pollution levels or requiring specific technologies.",qa,examples/Microeconomics.pdf
"When are command-and-control policies, such as prohibiting an act altogether, most appropriate for externalities?","When the external costs to society far exceed the benefits to the polluter, such as dumping poisonous chemicals into the water supply.",qa,examples/Microeconomics.pdf
"Instead of trying to eradicate pollution altogether, society has to {{c1::weigh the costs and benefits}} to decide the kinds and quantities of pollution it will allow.",weigh the costs and benefits,cloze,examples/Microeconomics.pdf

How do subsidies work to internalize positive externalities?,"They subsidize activities that have positive externalities, making the private benefit of the activity closer to the social benefit, thereby encouraging the activity.",qa,examples/Microeconomics.pdf
Why do economists generally prefer Pigovian taxes over regulations as a way to deal with pollution?,"Pigovian taxes can reduce pollution at a lower cost to society because they provide an incentive for firms to reduce pollution where it is least expensive to do so, rather than mandating an equal reduction for all.",qa,examples/Microeconomics.pdf
What is the main advantage of Pigovian taxes over direct regulation in reducing pollution?,Pigovian taxes allow pollution reduction to occur at the lowest possible cost to society by giving firms the flexibility to reduce pollution where it is cheapest.,qa,examples/Microeconomics.pdf
A Pigovian tax gives factory owners an {{c1::economic incentive}} to reduce pollution.,economic incentive,cloze,examples/Microeconomics.pdf
The EPA can achieve whatever level of pollution it wants by setting a Pigovian tax at the {{c1::appropriate level}}.,appropriate level,cloze,examples/Microeconomics.pdf
"In the example of a paper mill and a steel mill polluting, how would a Pigovian tax lead to a more efficient outcome than a regulation requiring equal pollution reduction?","A Pigovian tax allows each factory to reduce pollution by the amount that is most cost-effective for them; the factory with lower abatement costs will reduce more, while the one with higher costs will reduce less and pay the tax, leading to the same overall reduction at a lower total cost.",qa,examples/Microeconomics.pdf
"If a paper mill can reduce pollution at a lower cost than a steel mill, how would a Pigovian tax lead to a more efficient overall reduction compared to uniform regulation?","The paper mill would reduce pollution substantially to avoid the tax, while the steel mill would reduce less and pay the tax, resulting in the same overall pollution reduction achieved at a lower total cost for society.",qa,examples/Microeconomics.pdf
What is the primary difference between command-and-control policies and market-based policies in addressing externalities?,"Command-and-control policies directly regulate behavior (e.g., mandates, prohibitions), while market-based policies provide incentives for private decision-makers to choose to solve the problem themselves (e.g., taxes, subsidies).",qa,examples/Microeconomics.pdf

How does a gasoline tax help reduce congestion?,"By encouraging people to take public transportation, carpool more often, and live closer to work.",qa,examples/Microeconomics.pdf
How does a gasoline tax address the externality of accidents caused by large vehicles?,"It's an indirect way of making people pay when their large, gas-guzzling vehicles impose risk on others, making them account for this risk when choosing a vehicle.",qa,examples/Microeconomics.pdf
"When the EPA allows firms to trade the right to pollute, it essentially creates a new scarce resource called {{c1::pollution permits}}.",pollution permits,cloze,examples/Microeconomics.pdf
"From an economic efficiency standpoint, why is allowing firms to trade pollution permits considered good policy?","Because the deal makes the owners of the two factories better off (voluntary agreement), and the total amount of pollution remains the same, enhancing social welfare.",qa,examples/Microeconomics.pdf
"How does the ""invisible hand"" operate in a market for pollution permits?","It ensures that the market efficiently allocates the right to pollute, with firms that can reduce pollution at low cost selling permits and firms with high reduction costs buying them.",qa,examples/Microeconomics.pdf
One advantage of allowing a market for pollution permits is that the {{c1::initial allocation}} of permits among firms does not matter from the standpoint of economic efficiency.,initial allocation,cloze,examples/Microeconomics.pdf

What is the opportunity cost for a firm that already owns pollution permits and chooses to pollute?,The opportunity cost is what they could have received by selling their permits on the open market.,qa,examples/Microeconomics.pdf
"In the context of pollution control, how does a Pigovian tax affect the supply curve for pollution rights?",It makes the supply curve for pollution rights perfectly elastic because firms can pollute as much as they want by paying the tax.,qa,examples/Microeconomics.pdf
"In the context of pollution control, how do pollution permits affect the supply curve for pollution rights?",It makes the supply curve for pollution rights perfectly inelastic because the quantity of pollution is fixed by the number of permits.,qa,examples/Microeconomics.pdf

Under what specific circumstance might selling pollution permits be better than levying a Pigovian tax?,"When the EPA wants a specific quantity of pollution but does not know the demand curve for pollution, making it unsure what tax size would achieve that goal.",qa,examples/Microeconomics.pdf
"When the EPA does not know the demand curve for pollution, it can simply {{c1::auction off}} a specific number of pollution permits to achieve a desired quantity of pollution.",auction off,cloze,examples/Microeconomics.pdf
What is a common objection raised by some environmentalists against the economic analysis of pollution?,They argue that clean air and water are fundamental human rights that should not be debased by considering them in economic terms or by putting a price on them.,qa,examples/Microeconomics.pdf
"How do economists respond to the argument that environmental protection should be pursued ""regardless of the cost""?","Economists argue that ""people face tradeoffs"" and that the value of clean air/water must be compared to their opportunity cost, as eliminating all pollution is impossible and has significant costs.",qa,examples/Microeconomics.pdf
"To economists, a clean environment is a {{c1::good}} like other goods, subject to economic principles.",good,cloze,examples/Microeconomics.pdf
"According to economists, how does the income elasticity of demand apply to a clean environment?","It has a positive income elasticity, meaning rich countries can afford a cleaner environment than poor ones and usually have more rigorous environmental protection.",qa,examples/Microeconomics.pdf

Why is it difficult to determine the appropriate level of governmental support for basic research?,"Because the benefits are hard to measure, and members of Congress often lack expertise in science.",qa,examples/Microeconomics.pdf
What are the two main characteristics of a public good?,Public goods are non-excludable (people cannot be prevented from using them) and non-rival (one person's use does not diminish another's enjoyment).,qa,examples/Microeconomics.pdf
Public goods are characterized by being {{c1::non-excludable}} and {{c2::non-rival}}.,"non-excludable, non-rival",cloze,examples/Microeconomics.pdf
Why is a lighthouse typically considered a public good?,It is non-excludable (difficult to prevent ships from seeing the light) and non-rival (one ship's use doesn't diminish another's).,qa,examples/Microeconomics.pdf
"How can a lighthouse sometimes be closer to a private good, as seen in 19th-century England?","If its owner charges a nearby port owner for the service and can turn off the light if payment isn't made, making it excludable and primarily benefiting a single entity.",qa,examples/Microeconomics.pdf
"In 19th-century England, some lighthouses were privately owned and operated, charging the {{c1::port owner}} rather than ship captains.",port owner,cloze,examples/Microeconomics.pdf
What two factors determine if something is a public good?,The number of beneficiaries and whether these beneficiaries can be excluded from enjoying the good.,qa,examples/Microeconomics.pdf
What is the free-rider problem?,"It arises when a good's beneficiaries are numerous and cannot be excluded, leading individuals to consume the good without paying for it.",qa,examples/Microeconomics.pdf
A free-rider problem arises when the number of beneficiaries is {{c1::large}} and exclusion of any one of them is {{c2::impossible}}.,"large, impossible",cloze,examples/Microeconomics.pdf
Why does the free-rider problem induce the government to provide public goods?,"Because the private market on its own will not produce an efficient quantity due to the inability to charge beneficiaries, leading to underprovision.",qa,examples/Microeconomics.pdf
What is a cost-benefit analysis?,A study that compares the costs and benefits to society of providing a public good.,qa,examples/Microeconomics.pdf
A {{c1::cost-benefit analysis}} is a study that compares the costs and benefits to society of providing a public good.,cost-benefit analysis,cloze,examples/Microeconomics.pdf
What is the primary goal of a cost-benefit analysis for a public project?,To estimate the total costs and benefits of the project to society as a whole.,qa,examples/Microeconomics.pdf
Why does the government need to conduct cost-benefit analyses for public goods?,"Because the private market fails to provide an efficient quantity of public goods, the government must decide what kinds and quantities to provide.",qa,examples/Microeconomics.pdf
What is a major difficulty in judging the value of a public good like a new highway?,"Since it's available free of charge, there is no market price to judge its value.",qa,examples/Microeconomics.pdf

"For public goods, buyers do not reveal their value by prices, and sellers do not reveal costs, making cost-benefit findings {{c1::rough approximations}}.",rough approximations,cloze,examples/Microeconomics.pdf
Why is the efficient provision of public goods intrinsically more difficult than private goods?,"Because cost-benefit analysts lack the price signals (willingness to pay, willingness to accept) that exist in private markets.",qa,examples/Microeconomics.pdf
"In the traffic light case study, what was the proposed cost of the project?","$10,000",qa,examples/Microeconomics.pdf
What was the estimated benefit of the traffic light in the case study?,A reduction in the risk of a fatal traffic accident over its lifetime from 1.6% to 1.1%.,qa,examples/Microeconomics.pdf
What is the main obstacle in comparing the costs and benefits of the traffic light project?,"Costs are in dollars, but the benefit (saving a life) is not directly monetary, requiring a dollar value to be placed on a human life.",qa,examples/Microeconomics.pdf
Why is concluding that a human life is 'priceless' problematic for cost-benefit analysis?,"It leads to nonsensical results, implying we should spend infinite amounts on safety measures, which contradicts real-world public and private decisions.",qa,examples/Microeconomics.pdf
What is one approach courts sometimes use to value a life in wrongful-death suits?,Looking at the total amount of money a person would have earned if they had lived.,qa,examples/Microeconomics.pdf
Why are economists critical of valuing a life based on lost earnings?,It implies that the life of a retired or disabled person has no value.,qa,examples/Microeconomics.pdf
What is a better way economists value human life for cost-benefit analysis?,"By looking at the risks people are voluntarily willing to take and how much they must be paid for taking them (e.g., comparing wages in risky vs. less risky jobs).",qa,examples/Microeconomics.pdf
Studies using the 'willingness to take risks for pay' approach conclude that the value of a human life is about {{c1::$10 million}}.,$10 million,cloze,examples/Microeconomics.pdf

The {{c1::Tragedy of the Commons}} is a parable that illustrates why common resources get used more than is desirable from the standpoint of society as a whole.,Tragedy of the Commons,cloze,examples/Microeconomics.pdf
Describe the setting of the Tragedy of the Commons parable.,A small medieval town where families graze their sheep on collectively owned land called the Town Common.,qa,examples/Microeconomics.pdf
What happens to the Town Common as the town's population and sheep numbers grow in the parable?,"The land is grazed so heavily that it becomes barren, making raising sheep impossible and destroying the town's wool industry.",qa,examples/Microeconomics.pdf
Why does the Tragedy of the Commons occur?,"Because social and private incentives differ; no single family has an incentive to reduce its flock, and people neglect the negative externality their grazing has on others.",qa,examples/Microeconomics.pdf
The Tragedy of the Commons arises because of a {{c1::negative externality}}.,negative externality,cloze,examples/Microeconomics.pdf
What is the negative externality in the Tragedy of the Commons?,"When one family's flock grazes on common land, it reduces the quality of land available for other families.",qa,examples/Microeconomics.pdf

How can government regulation help solve the common-resource problem of an oil pool with many owners?,It can ensure that the oil is extracted efficiently.,qa,examples/Microeconomics.pdf
When is a road considered a public good?,"If it is not congested, because one person's use does not affect anyone else, meaning use is not rival.",qa,examples/Microeconomics.pdf
When is a road considered a common resource?,"If it is congested, because one person's use creates a negative externality by making it more crowded and slowing others down.",qa,examples/Microeconomics.pdf

A road that is not congested is an example of a {{c1::public good}}.,public good,cloze,examples/Microeconomics.pdf
What is one way for the government to address the problem of road congestion?,To charge drivers a toll.,qa,examples/Microeconomics.pdf
A toll on a congested road is essentially a {{c1::Pigovian tax}} on the externality of congestion.,Pigovian tax,cloze,examples/Microeconomics.pdf
Why are tolls not always a practical solution for local road congestion?,The cost of collecting them can be too high.,qa,examples/Microeconomics.pdf
"What is an efficient way to deal with congestion externalities that occur only at certain times of day, such as rush hour?",Charge higher tolls during rush hour.,qa,examples/Microeconomics.pdf
Charging higher tolls during rush hour provides an incentive for drivers to {{c1::alter their schedules}}.,alter their schedules,cloze,examples/Microeconomics.pdf
How does a tax on gasoline help reduce road congestion?,"Gasoline is a complementary good to driving, so an increase in its price reduces the quantity of driving demanded.",qa,examples/Microeconomics.pdf
A gasoline tax is an {{c1::imperfect}} solution to road congestion because it also discourages driving on noncongested roads.,imperfect,cloze,examples/Microeconomics.pdf

What were two reasons London rejected road pricing in its report on auto congestion?,They feared it would be seen as too much government interference and that the public would not tolerate a system allowing the rich to drive more than the poor.,qa,examples/Microeconomics.pdf
"Lester Thurow argued that new technologies like bar codes and debit cards could address concerns about road pricing, including the perception that it would allow the {{c1::rich to drive more than the poor}}.",rich to drive more than the poor,cloze,examples/Microeconomics.pdf
"How can a road pricing system using debit cards be designed to be egalitarian, according to Thurow?","Each auto can be given a specified debit card balance annually, allowing those who drive less to sell their unused balances to those who want to drive more.",qa,examples/Microeconomics.pdf
An egalitarian road pricing system can result in an income redistribution from the {{c1::rich to the poor}} because poor people tend to drive less.,rich to the poor,cloze,examples/Microeconomics.pdf

An uncongested bridge is an example of a natural monopoly because it is excludable but not {{c1::rival}}.,rival,cloze,examples/Microeconomics.pdf
Why is an uncongested bridge considered a natural monopoly?,"It has a fixed cost of building and a negligible marginal cost for additional users, so the average total cost of a trip falls as the number of trips rises.",qa,examples/Microeconomics.pdf
"When a firm is a natural monopoly, it is less concerned about new entrants eroding its monopoly power because would-be entrants cannot achieve the same {{c1::low costs}}.",low costs,cloze,examples/Microeconomics.pdf

What is the key difference between a competitive firm and a monopoly regarding price?,"A competitive firm is a price taker and cannot influence the price of its output, while a monopoly can influence the price of its output by adjusting the quantity it supplies.",qa,examples/Microeconomics.pdf
A competitive firm faces a {{c1::horizontal}} demand curve.,horizontal,cloze,examples/Microeconomics.pdf
Why does a competitive firm face a horizontal demand curve?,"Because it is small relative to the market and sells a product with many perfect substitutes, it can sell as much or as little as it wants at the given market price.",qa,examples/Microeconomics.pdf

What is the goal of a monopoly firm regarding profit?,"To maximize profit, which is total revenue minus total costs.",qa,examples/Microeconomics.pdf
How is total revenue (TR) calculated for a firm?,Price (P) multiplied by Quantity (Q). (TR = P × Q),qa,examples/Microeconomics.pdf
Average revenue (AR) is the amount of revenue the firm receives per unit sold. It is calculated as total revenue divided by {{c1::quantity}}.,quantity,cloze,examples/Microeconomics.pdf

"For a monopoly, marginal revenue is always {{c1::less than}} the price of its good.",less than,cloze,examples/Microeconomics.pdf
Explain why a monopolist's marginal revenue is less than its price.,"To increase the amount sold, a monopoly firm must lower the price of its good. This means it receives less revenue for the additional unit sold AND less revenue for all the units it was already selling (the price effect).",qa,examples/Microeconomics.pdf
"When a monopoly increases the amount it sells, what are the two effects on total revenue?","1. The output effect: More output is sold, so Q is higher. 2. The price effect: The price falls, so P is lower.",qa,examples/Microeconomics.pdf
"For a competitive firm, its marginal revenue equals the {{c1::price}} of its good.",price,cloze,examples/Microeconomics.pdf
Why does a competitive firm's marginal revenue equal its price?,Because a competitive firm is a price taker and faces no price effect; it can sell all it wants at the market price without affecting the price of units it was already selling.,qa,examples/Microeconomics.pdf
A monopoly's marginal-revenue curve lies {{c1::below}} its demand curve.,below,cloze,examples/Microeconomics.pdf
When can marginal revenue for a monopoly become negative?,"Marginal revenue becomes negative when the price effect on revenue is greater than the output effect, causing total revenue to decline even as more units are sold.",qa,examples/Microeconomics.pdf

Explain why a monopolist will always produce a quantity at which the demand curve is elastic.,"If demand were inelastic, the monopolist could increase total revenue by raising its price. Raising price would also decrease quantity sold, thus decreasing total costs.

Should the government regulate the prices of a unique resource like Whitney Houston's concerts? Why or why not?,"Generally no. While she has a 'monopoly' over her unique talent, this is not a market failure in the traditional sense of a firm exploiting market power over a commodity.

"If a monopolist incurs a fixed cost (C) to price discriminate, how does it decide whether to pay this cost?",The monopolist will pay the fixed cost C if the additional profit gained from price discrimination (which includes the original deadweight loss and consumer surplus captured) is greater than C.,qa,examples/Microeconomics.pdf
How does a benevolent social planner decide whether a monopolist should incur a fixed cost (C) to price discriminate?,"The social planner would decide based on whether the increase in total surplus (which is the original deadweight loss eliminated by perfect price discrimination) is greater than C.

Is it possible that a monopolist will price discriminate even though it is not socially desirable?,"Yes. The monopolist considers the gain in its own profit (which includes capturing consumer surplus), while a social planner only considers the reduction in deadweight loss.

How is the income effect reflected in an indifference curve diagram?,It is reflected in the movement from a lower to a higher indifference curve.,qa,examples/Microeconomics.pdf
How is the substitution effect reflected in an indifference curve diagram?,It is reflected by a movement along an indifference curve to a point with a different slope.,qa,examples/Microeconomics.pdf
A {{c1::normal good}} is a good for which an increase in income leads to an increase in demand.,normal good,cloze,examples/Microeconomics.pdf
An {{c1::inferior good}} is a good for which an increase in income leads to a decrease in demand.,inferior good,cloze,examples/Microeconomics.pdf
{{c1::Perfect substitutes}} are two goods for which the marginal rate of substitution is constant.,perfect substitutes,cloze,examples/Microeconomics.pdf
{{c1::Perfect complements}} are two goods for which the indifference curves are right angles.,perfect complements,cloze,examples/Microeconomics.pdf
"A {{c1::Giffen good}} is a hypothetical inferior good for which the income effect outweighs the substitution effect, leading to an upward-sloping demand curve.",Giffen good,cloze,examples/Microeconomics.pdf
List two real-world applications of the theory of consumer choice mentioned in the text.,"It can explain why demand curves can potentially slope upward, why higher wages could either increase or decrease the quantity of labor supplied, why higher interest rates could either increase or decrease saving, and why the poor prefer cash to in-kind transfers. (Any two are acceptable)",qa,examples/Microeconomics.pdf
How can the theory of consumer choice explain why higher wages might decrease the amount a person wants to work?,"An increase in wages has both an income effect (making the person feel richer, potentially leading to more leisure) and a substitution effect (making leisure more expensive, encouraging more work). If the income effect outweighs the substitution effect, work hours could decrease.",qa,examples/Microeconomics.pdf
How can the theory of consumer choice explain why higher interest rates might decrease saving?,"A higher interest rate makes future consumption cheaper (substitution effect, encouraging saving) but also makes a saver richer (income effect, potentially leading to more current consumption and less saving). If the income effect outweighs the substitution effect, saving could decrease.",qa,examples/Microeconomics.pdf
"What type of good is associated with a potentially upward-sloping demand curve, according    to the theory of consumer choice?",A Giffen good.,qa,examples/Microeconomics.pdf
"If a consumer's income increases and both wine and cheese are normal goods, how would their consumption of both goods change?",Consumption of both wine and cheese would increase.,qa,examples/Microeconomics.pdf
"If a consumer's income increases and cheese is an inferior good, how would their consumption of cheese change?",Consumption of cheese would decrease.,qa,examples/Microeconomics.pdf
Could cheese and crackers both be inferior goods for Mario? Explain.,"No. If both were inferior goods, an increase in income would lead to a decrease in consumption of both, which is impossible as the consumer must spend their income on something. At least one good must be normal.",qa,examples/Microeconomics.pdf
"If the price of cheese falls and cheese is a normal good, what happens to Mario's consumption of cheese?",Consumption of cheese would increase due to both income and substitution effects.,qa,examples/Microeconomics.pdf
"If the price of cheese falls, and crackers are an inferior good, what happens to Mario's consumption of crackers?","Consumption of crackers would decrease, as both the substitution effect (cheese is relatively cheaper) and the income effect (being effectively richer, thus consuming less of an inferior good) lead to less cracker consumption.",qa,examples/Microeconomics.pdf
What is the marginal rate of substitution at the optimal consumption choice if the price of wine is $3 a glass and the price of cheese is $6 a pound?,"The MRS would be 2 (meaning the consumer is willing to trade 2 glasses of wine for 1 pound of cheese, or vice versa, at the optimum).",qa,examples/Microeconomics.pdf
"If the price of wine is $3 a glass and the price of cheese is $6 a pound, the relative price of cheese in terms of wine is {{c1::2}}.",2,cloze,examples/Microeconomics.pdf
What is one property of indifference curves related to their slope?,Indifference curves are typically downward sloping.,qa,examples/Microeconomics.pdf
What is one property of indifference curves related to their intersection?,Indifference curves do not cross each other.,qa,examples/Microeconomics.pdf
What is one property of indifference curves related to their shape?,Indifference curves are typically bowed inward (convex to the origin).,qa,examples/Microeconomics.pdf

Which effect (income or substitution) causes a movement along an indifference curve?,The substitution effect.,qa,examples/Microeconomics.pdf
Which effect (income or substitution) causes a movement to a different indifference curve?,The income effect.,qa,examples/Microeconomics.pdf
"If all prices and a consumer's income increase by the same percentage (e.g., 10%), how does their budget constraint change?","The budget constraint remains unchanged, as the relative prices and real income are the same.",qa,examples/Microeconomics.pdf
"If all prices and a consumer's income increase by the same percentage, how would their optimal combination of goods compare to before the change?","The optimal combination of goods would remain the same, as their real income and relative prices have not changed.",qa,examples/Microeconomics.pdf
"If a town receives unrestricted state aid, how does this affect its budget constraint for education and non-education spending?","It shifts the budget constraint outward in a parallel fashion, increasing the town's total available funds for both categories.",qa,examples/Microeconomics.pdf
"If state aid is restricted to be spent entirely on education, how does this affect a town's budget constraint for education and non-education spending?","It creates a kink in the budget constraint, similar to an in-kind transfer, ensuring a minimum level of education spending.",qa,examples/Microeconomics.pdf
