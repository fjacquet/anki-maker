## Key Concepts

**Photosynthesis** is the process by which plants convert light energy into chemical energy.
This process occurs in the chloroplasts of plant cells and involves two main stages:

1. **Light-dependent reactions**: These occur in the thylakoids and capture light energy to produce ATP and NADPH.
2. **Light-independent reactions** (Calvin cycle): These occur in the stroma and use ATP and NADPH to convert CO2 into glucose.

## Important Facts

- Photosynthesis produces oxygen as a byproduct
- The overall equation is: 6CO2 + 6H2O + light energy â†’ C6H12O6 + 6O2
- Chlorophyll is the primary pigment responsible for capturing light energy
- Plants are autotrophs because they can produce their own food through photosynthesis
